## Data Offers with Server Components on the Edge
👉 Global EDGE Runtime powered by Vercel <br />
👉 React Server Components <br />
👉 Latest Next.js 13.4 app router with middleware <br />
👉 PlanetScale DB <br />
Read data from 3 locations - Frankfurt, Mumbai, Singapore <br />
DB is chosen based on user location <br />
👉 Drizzle ORM to write mysql queries <br />
👉 Mixpanel for analytics and custom events <br />
mixpanel-browser cannot run on the Edge. It was collapsing the site, so I had to move it to an api route <br />
👉 Tailwind for css <br />
It is just the best way to write optimized css <br />

Global EDGE runtime with ability to read data from multiple (closest to user) locations from DB makes compute always near the user, which results in ridiculously fast site experience ⚡️
